# suchonasb-Brain_Tumor_Classification
Here I've tried to build a model that can classify Brain Tumor using MRI images. So, the focus was on applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with Transfer Learning and advanced Deep Learning techniques like Multi-Head Attention for classifying Brain efficiently and accurately.
